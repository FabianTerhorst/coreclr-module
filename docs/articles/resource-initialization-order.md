# Resource initialization order

## Why you should know the initialization order

The `Resource` and `AsyncResource` classes provide overridable methods to modify the instantiation of players or vehicles and to modify the pools of those entities - just to name some.

Now, one could need custom parameters while instantiating, for example, a new class inheriting from `IPlayer`, assuming that there exists a player factory (`MyPlayerFactory`) using a custom argument (`myConstant`) in the constructor, which is later on passed to the player class.

```csharp
public override IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory()
{
    return new MyPlayerFactory(/* insert your value for myConstant */);
}
```

This could be an example, where a constructor argument is needed. Now, consider the case where your player - and thus your player factory - needs a constructor value which is also used by other components later on in the initialization process.

Then you probably would like to know which initialization order the alt:V follows, to provide the correct instances and values to all of your components.

For example, for the example above, you would have to create the value in the constructor and save it to a class variable like this:

```csharp
class MyResource : Resource
{
    private string mySecret;

    public MyResource()
    {
        mySecret = "1234";
    }
    
    public override IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory()
    {
        return new MyPlayerFactory(mySecret);
    }
    
    public override OnStart()
    {
        // we could need our secret also here
        new AnotherComponent(mySecret);
    }
    
    public override OnStop() {}
}
```

## Initialization order

The initialization order is as follows:

### 1. Resource constructor

A resource in C# is created by either inheriting from `Resource` or `AsyncResource` on a class and provide overrides for `OnStart()` and `OnStop()`.

The constructor of the class inheriting from `Resource` or `AsyncResource` is called first, which makes sense because the class of the resource has to be instantiated.

### 2. Entity factories and entity pool methods

Second, the entity factory and entity pool methods are called, since before the resource starts, the internal module (of type `Module`) has to know about all factories and pools as they can not be changed later on.

### 3. `GetModule` override

After the creation of entity factories and entity pools, `GetModule` is called with all its arguments.

### 4. `OnStart` override

Nothing much to say about it. The literal start of the resource is about to be begin.

### 5. Intermediate overrides and events

All events known to the public API (`AltV.Net.Alt.On...`) and the method `OnTick(...)` are possible to be called multiple times between `OnStart()` and `OnStop()`, since events can occur multiple times and a tick occurs every few milliseconds.

### 6. `OnStop` override on resource stop OR graceful server shutdown

The last step is the stop of the alt:V server.

Keep in mind that `OnStop` is only called if the resource was stopped manually using the alt:V API or by gracefully stopping the alt:V server. Otherwise, this event **will not be executed**!
