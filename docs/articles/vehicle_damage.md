## Normal event handler

```csharp
Alt.OnVehicleDamage += (target, attacker, bodyHealthDamage, additionalBodyHealthDamage, engineHealthDamage, petrolTankDamage, weapon) => {
    // ...
}
```

## IScript event handler

##### Note : ScriptEvents have to be created in a IScript Class! Otherwise it wonÂ´t work!

```csharp 
    // We create our IScript class
    public class MyScriptClass : IScript
    {
         // We declare and create our event handler
        [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.VehicleDamage)]
        public void OnVehicleDamage(IVehicle target, IEntity attacker, uint bodyHealthDamage, uint additionalBodyHealthDamage, uint engineHealthDamage, uint petrolTankDamage,  uint weapon)
        {
            // Simple output.
            target.Driver?.SendChatMessage("Your vehicle recieved damage.");
        }
    }
```
