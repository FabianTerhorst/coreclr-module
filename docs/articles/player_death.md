## Normal event handler

```csharp
Alt.OnPlayerDead += (player, entity, weapon) => {
    // ...
}
```

## IScript event handler

##### Note : ScriptEvents have to be created in a IScript Class! Otherwise it wonÂ´t work!

```csharp 
    // We create our IScript class
    public class MyScriptClass : IScript
    {
        // We declare and create our event handler
        [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.PlayerDead)]
        public static void OnPlayerDead(IPlayer player, IEntity entity, uint weapon)
        {
            // Event will be called only if the killer is a player.
            if (!(entity is IPlayer killer)) return;
            // If you killed yourself then it should notify you
            if (killer == player) {
                player.SendChatMessage("You killed yourself");
            }
            else
            {
                // We notify the killer and the player.
                killer.SendChatMessage("You killed " + player.Name);
                player.SendChatMessage(killer?.Name + " killed you!");
            }
            // We spawn the dead player after 1000ms at (0, 0, 72)
            player.Spawn(new Position(0, 0, 72), 1000);
        }
    }
```
