public class MyScriptClass : IScript
{
    // We declare and create our event handler
    [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.PlayerDamage)]
    public static void PlayerDamage(IPlayer player, IEntity attacker, uint weapon, ushort healthDamage, ushort armourDamage)
    {
        // We create a switch-statement where we check the type of our IEntity.
        switch (attacker)
        {
            case IPlayer sender:
                player.SendChatMessage("You received damage by " + sender.Name + ".");
                player.SendChatMessage("His weapon was a " + (WeaponModel)weapon + ".");
