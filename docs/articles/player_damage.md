    [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.WeaponDamage)]
    public static void WeaponDamage(IPlayer player, IPlayer target, uint weapon, ushort dmg, Position offset, BodyPart bodypart)
    {

        /* We Convert the Weapon uint to a regular WeaponModel Enum. */
        AltV.Net.Enums.WeaponModel weaponModel = (AltV.Net.Enums.WeaponModel)weapon;
        /* We notify the player. */
        player?.SendChatMessage("You hitted " + target?.Name + " and gave him " + dmg + " damage! Weapon: " + weaponModel);
        target?.SendChatMessage(player?.Name + " hitted you and gave you " + dmg + " damage! Weapon: " + weaponModel);

        /* We check if the BodyPart is his Pelvis ... */
        if (bodypart == BodyPart.Pelvis)
